  abstract = {Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancer kinds. CT scan imaging has made it easier to observe in- depth at different lung cancer conditions. Convolutional Neural Networks have already been utilized for detecting objects in images. This research implements a lightweight CNN architecture in classifying two types of cancerous images and distinguishingthem from healthy ones. AlexNet, ResNet101 V2, DenseNet201,MobileNet V2, and other sizable deep learning and transferlearning models were tested against this unique architecturewith global max pooling. The proposed CNN model overlapsin performance with much bigger models whilst using abouteight times fewer parameters, thus being efficient. Apart frommaking the architecture smaller, Grad-CAM was used to explainthe convolutional flow over different convolution layers. Thisintegration of the Grad-CAM technique into the analysis adds acrucial layer of transparency to the deep-learning models. By vi-sualizing the regions within lung cancer images that significantlyinfluence predictions, we aim to enhance the interpretabilityof our model, fostering trust and better understanding amonghealthcare professionals.}
